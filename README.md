# Analysis-of-Average-House-Prices-in-Seattle
## Introduction
Housing prices represent a crucial economic indicator that significantly influences both investment decisions and consumer behavior. In this study, we analyze a univariate time series of monthly average housing prices in Seattle, obtained from Zillow Research Data[7]
. The data we are using reports the average monthly prices of houses between the 33rd and 67th percentiles, thus providing an indicator of the typical middle-income house price in the Seattle Metropolitan area. Although the original dataset spans from February 1996 to December 2024 with 348 records, its extensive duration and the occurrence of multiple historical events such as the Dot-Com Bubble Burst (2000â€“2001) and the Great Recession (2007-2009) makes comprehensive analysis extremely challenging. Therefore, we focus on the most recent decade, from January 2015 to December 2024 with 120 records, to capture current market dynamics. The plot of the sliced data is shown as below. It reveals a clear upward trend with potential seasonal patterns and significant market shifts, particularly during the 2020-2022 period. The median housing price in Seattle in the recent decade is $517,473 as shown in the below summary table.
